In this Jump'n'Run game you've got to run through a horizontally scrolling volcanic cave, fleeing from a wall of fire.
Running through the cave, you'll face some traps, enemies and items, which will try to prohibit your escape:

- Landmines blow up on contact causing heavy damage.

- Fire fountains block your way temporarily.

- Some crazy cave moles will throw earth chunks at you.

- Stalactites hanging from the cave ceiling may fall down and carve a neat hole into your head.

- Sometimes, fireballs will be casted from the wall of fire. Evade!

- Coil springs will make your player jump highly.

- Of course, you shouldn't get too close to the flaming wall unless you want to get toasted.


Hm. Game goal? There isn't any but moving right as far as possible. Your results will be saved and ranked in a high score table.
